# RayWaves Game Engine - User Guide

Welcome to RayWaves Game Engine! This is a powerful 2D game development platform that combines a visual editor with hot-reloadable game logic, perfect for rapid game development and prototyping.

## 🚀 Quick Start - Getting Your Engine Running

### Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment
1. **Open Visual Studio Code**
2. **Open the engine directory** in VS Code (File → Open Folder → Select your engine folder)
3. **Open the integrated terminal** by pressing `Ctrl + ` (backtick) or going to Terminal → New Terminal

### Step 2: Launch the Engine
In the VS Code terminal, type:
```bash
./editor.exe
```

That's it! The RayWaves engine editor will launch with:
- **Scene View**: Real-time preview of your game world
- **Control Panel**: Play, pause, restart, and compilation controls
- **Map Selector**: Switch between different game levels
- **Settings Panel**: Adjust scene resolution and export options

## 🎮 Understanding the Engine

### What You Get
- **Visual Editor**: See your game running in real-time
- **Hot Reload**: Modify code and see changes instantly without restarting
- **Built-in Tools**: Particle systems, map management, asset loading
- **Export System**: Create standalone game distributions

### Project Structure Overview
```

```

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Making Your First Changes
1. **With the engine running**, open any file in the `GameLogic/` folder (try `Level1.cpp`)
2. **Make a small change** - maybe modify some text or a number
3. **Save the file** (`Ctrl+S`)
4. **In the terminal**, run the build script:
   ```bash
   ./build_gamelogic.bat
   ```
5. **Watch the magic!** Your changes appear in the running engine automatically

No more waiting for full rebuilds or losing your game state!

## 🎯 Core Development Concepts

### Game Maps/Levels
Your game is organized into "maps" (levels or scenes). Each map is a C++ class that handles:
- **Initialize()**: Set up your level (called when level starts or restarts)
- **Update()**: Game logic that runs every frame  
- **Draw()**: What appears on screen

### Example: Basic Level Structure
```cpp
class MyLevel : public GameMap {
public:
    MyLevel() : GameMap("My Level") {}

    void Initialize() override {
        // Set up your level here
        player_x = 100;
        player_y = 100;
    }
    
    void Update(float delta_time) override {
        // Game logic goes here
        if (IsKeyDown(KEY_RIGHT)) player_x += 200 * delta_time;
        if (IsKeyDown(KEY_LEFT))  player_x -= 200 * delta_time;
    }
    
    void Draw() override {
        // Drawing code here
        DrawRectangle((int)player_x, (int)player_y, 32, 32, RED);
        DrawText("Use arrow keys to move", 10, 10, 20, BLACK);
    }

private:
    float player_x, player_y;
};
```

### Multiple Levels
You can create multiple levels and switch between them in the editor:
- Create new `.cpp/.h` files in `GameLogic/`
- Implement the `GameMap` interface
- Register them in `RootManager.cpp`

### Registering Maps
After creating a new level, you need to register it so the engine knows about it. Open `GameLogic/RootManager.cpp` and follow these steps:

1. **Include your level header** at the top of the file:
   ```cpp
   #include "../Engine/MapManager.h"
   #include "Level1.h"
   #include "Level2.h"
   #include "MyNewLevel.h"  // Add your new level here
   ```

2. **Register your map** inside the `CreateGameMap()` function:
   ```cpp
   extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) GameMap* CreateGameMap()
   {
       if (s_GameMapManager == nullptr)
       {
           s_GameMapManager = new MapManager();

           // Register your game maps
           s_GameMapManager->RegisterMap<Level1>("Level1");
           s_GameMapManager->RegisterMap<Level2>("Level2");
           s_GameMapManager->RegisterMap<MyNewLevel>("MyNewLevel");  // Add this line
       }

       // Automatically load the first registered map
       auto available_maps = s_GameMapManager->GetAvailableMaps();
       if (!available_maps.empty())
       {
           s_GameMapManager->b_GotoMap(available_maps.at(0));
       }

       return s_GameMapManager;
   }
   ```

3. **Rebuild your game logic** using `build_gamelogic.bat`

4. **Your new level** will now appear in the Map Selector dropdown in the editor!

**Important Notes:**
- The string name (e.g., `"MyNewLevel"`) is what appears in the editor dropdown
- Maps are loaded in the order they're registered
- The first registered map loads automatically when the game starts

### Built-in Features You Can Use
- **Particle Systems**: `FireParticle` for effects
- **Input Handling**: `IsKeyDown()`, `IsMouseButtonPressed()`, etc.
- **Asset Loading**: `LoadTexture()`, `LoadSound()`, `LoadFont()`
- **Drawing Functions**: `DrawTexture()`, `DrawText()`, `DrawRectangle()`, etc.

## ⚙️ Configuration and Settings

### Game Configuration (`game_config.ini`)
Adjust your game's basic settings:
```ini
width=1280          # Window width in pixels
height=720          # Window height in pixels
b_Fullscreen=false  # Start in fullscreen?
b_Resizable=true    # Allow window resizing?
b_Vsync=true        # Smooth rendering?
target_fps=60       # Target framerate
title=RayWaves Game # Window title
```

### Editor Controls
- **Play Button**: Start/resume game logic
- **Pause Button**: Freeze game logic
- **Restart Button**: Reset current level
- **Compile Button**: Manual rebuild (same as running build script)
- **Map Dropdown**: Switch between different levels
- **Export Panel**: Package your finished game

## 📁 Working with Assets

### Adding Your Own Assets
1. **Place files** in the `Assets/` folder:
   ```
   Assets/
   ├── textures/
   │   ├── player.png
   │   └── background.jpg
   ├── sounds/
   │   ├── jump.wav
   │   └── music.ogg
   └── fonts/
       └── game_font.ttf
   ```

2. **Load them in your code**:
   ```cpp
   Texture2D playerTexture = LoadTexture("Assets/textures/player.png");
   Sound jumpSound = LoadSound("Assets/sounds/jump.wav");
   Font gameFont = LoadFont("Assets/fonts/game_font.ttf");
   ```

3. **Rebuild** your game logic to use them

### Supported File Formats
- **Images**: PNG, JPG, BMP, TGA
- **Audio**: WAV, MP3, OGG
- **Fonts**: TTF, OTF

## 📦 Exporting Your Game

When you're ready to share your creation:

1. **Click "Export Game"** in the editor's export panel
2. **Configure settings**:
   - Choose output folder and game name
   - Set window size and display options
   - Adjust performance settings
3. **Click "Start Export"**
4. **Wait for completion** - you'll get a standalone game folder

The exported game includes everything needed to run on other computers!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Build failed" Error
**If `build_gamelogic.bat` fails:**
- Make sure you opened the folder in VS Code properly
- Check that you have Visual Studio or Build Tools installed
- Try running VS Code as administrator

### Changes Not Appearing
**If hot reload isn't working:**
- Verify the build script completed successfully
- Check that `GameLogic.dll` file timestamp updated
- Try pausing and playing in the editor

### Performance Issues
**If the engine runs slowly:**
- Check your `Update()` functions aren't doing too much work
- Reduce particle effects if using them
- Adjust settings in `game_config.ini`

### Can't Find Files
**If assets won't load:**
- Double-check file paths (use forward slashes: `"Assets/player.png"`)
- Ensure file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Verify files are in the correct folders

## 📚 Learning Path

### Beginner Steps
1. **Run the engine** and explore the sample levels
2. **Make small edits** to `Level1.cpp` and see them change
3. **Add simple features** like new colors, shapes, or text
4. **Try adding movement** or simple interactions

### Intermediate Projects
1. **Create a new level** by copying and modifying existing ones
2. **Add your own assets** (images and sounds)
3. **Implement simple game mechanics** (scoring, collision)
4. **Experiment with particles** for visual effects

### Advanced Development
1. **Study the engine headers** in the `Engine/` folder
2. **Create complex interactions** between multiple objects
3. **Build complete game systems** (menus, multiple levels)
4. **Export and distribute** your finished games
