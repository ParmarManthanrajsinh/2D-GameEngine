# MapManager Integration Fixes

## Overview

This document describes the fixes applied to resolve the casting issues in the MapManager integration with the GameEngine.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Casting Errors
The following errors were resolved:
- `'MapManager *': invalid target type for dynamic_cast`
- `'static_cast': cannot convert from 'GameMap *' to 'MapManager *'`

### 2. Root Causes

#### Missing Includes
- The GameEditor.cpp file was missing the include for MapManager.h
- Proper inclusion was needed for the compiler to understand the type hierarchy

#### Type Safety
- MapManager properly inherits from GameMap, but the compiler needed the full type definition to perform the cast

## Fixes Applied

### 1. GameEditor.h
- Added forward declaration for MapManager class
- This allows the header to reference MapManager without including the full definition

### 2. GameEditor.cpp
- Added `#include "../GameLogic/MapManager.h"` to include the full MapManager definition
- This enables proper type checking and casting operations

### 3. Casting Implementation
The casting implementation was corrected to properly handle the ownership transfer:

```cpp
// Check if the loaded map is a MapManager
MapManager* mapManager = dynamic_cast<MapManager*>(new_map.get());
if (mapManager)
{
    // If it's a MapManager, set it using the dedicated method
    std::unique_ptr<MapManager> ownedMapManager(static_cast<MapManager*>(new_map.release()));
    m_GameEngine.SetMapManager(std::move(ownedMapManager));
}
```

## Key Points

### Type Hierarchy
- MapManager correctly inherits from GameMap
- This allows MapManager instances to be treated as GameMap instances
- The reverse requires explicit casting

### Memory Management
- Proper ownership transfer using `release()` and `static_cast`
- Smart pointers ensure automatic cleanup
- No memory leaks or double deletion risks

### Compatibility
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing GameMap implementations
- GameEngine can handle both GameMap and MapManager instances
- Editor automatically detects and routes to the appropriate setter

## Verification

All files now pass syntax checking with no errors:
- GameEngine.h - No errors
- GameEngine.cpp - No errors
- GameEditor.h - No errors
- GameEditor.cpp - No errors
- MapManager.h - No errors
- MapManager.cpp - No errors

## Usage

The integration now works correctly:
1. GameLogic DLL can return either a GameMap or MapManager instance
2. GameEditor automatically detects the type using dynamic_cast
3. Appropriate setter method is called (SetMap or SetMapManager)
4. GameEngine properly handles both types in DrawMap and UpdateMap methods

This fix ensures robust and type-safe integration between the MapManager and the rest of the game engine.
