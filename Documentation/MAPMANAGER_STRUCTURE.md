# MapManager Code Structure

## üìÅ **File Organization**

The MapManager has been restructured for better code organization and maintainability:

### **Core Files:**
- **[MapManager.h](file://d:\2D-GameEngine\GameLogic\MapManager.h)** - Main header with clean, well-documented API
- **[MapManager.cpp](file://d:\2D-GameEngine\GameLogic\MapManager.cpp)** - Implementation with concise, focused code
- **[DemoMaps.h](file://d:\2D-GameEngine\GameLogic\DemoMaps.h)** - Demo maps separated for cleaner core code

### **Benefits of This Structure:**

‚úÖ **Cleaner Core Code** - MapManager.cpp is now focused only on core functionality  
‚úÖ **Modular Design** - Demo maps are in their own file  
‚úÖ **Easier Maintenance** - Changes to demo maps don't affect core MapManager  
‚úÖ **Better Organization** - Each file has a clear, single responsibility  
‚úÖ **Developer Friendly** - Easy to understand and extend  

### **How It Works:**

1. **[MapManager.h](file://d:\2D-GameEngine\GameLogic\MapManager.h)** provides the public API with comprehensive documentation
2. **[MapManager.cpp](file://d:\2D-GameEngine\GameLogic\MapManager.cpp)** implements the core functionality without clutter
3. **[DemoMaps.h](file://d:\2D-GameEngine\GameLogic\DemoMaps.h)** contains example maps for demonstration purposes

### **For Game Developers:**

When creating your own game maps, you would:
1. Create your map classes (inheriting from GameMap)
2. Register them using the simple `RegisterMap<YourMap>("id")` syntax
3. Switch between maps using `GoToMap("id")`

The separation keeps the core MapManager clean while providing clear examples in a separate file!
